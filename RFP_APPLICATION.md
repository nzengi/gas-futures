## Problem Statement

Gas prices on the SUI blockchain exhibit significant volatility due to:

- Short-term SUI token price fluctuations
- Network congestion variations
- Market demand dynamics
- External economic factors

This volatility creates challenges for:

- **Businesses**: Unpredictable operational costs
- **DeFi Protocols**: Inconsistent gas overhead
- **Developers**: Budget planning difficulties
- **Users**: Cost uncertainty for transactions

## Solution Overview

### Gas Futures Mechanism

Our protocol implements a complete gas futures system that allows users to:

1. **Pre-purchase Gas Credits**: Lock in future gas prices at predefined rates
2. **Hedge Volatility Risk**: Protect against gas price spikes
3. **Sponsored Transactions**: Execute transactions without immediate gas costs
4. **Flexible Expiry**: Choose from various time horizons (1 week to 1 year)

### Core Features

- **Automated Market Makers**: Ready for DeepBook integration
- **Liquidity Provider Incentives**: Fee sharing and reward mechanisms
- **Pooled Risk Models**: Distributed risk across multiple participants

#### ✅ Advanced Pricing Model

- **Black-Scholes Variant**: Sophisticated option pricing
- **Volatility Index**: Real-time market volatility tracking
- **Time Decay**: Dynamic pricing based on time to expiry
- **Market Demand**: Supply-demand equilibrium pricing

#### ✅ Smart Contract Infrastructure

- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient Move code for minimal costs
- **Event System**: Complete transaction logging
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions and governance

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture

```
sources/
├── futures_token.move      // Core token functionality
├── risk_pool.move         // Risk management and liquidity
├── redemption.move        // Sponsored transaction execution
├── oracle_integration.move // Real-time price feeds
├── emergency.move         // Emergency controls and governance
├── pricing.move           // Advanced pricing algorithms
└── global_state.move      // Global state management
```

### Key Technical Features

#### 1. Gas Future Token (`futures_token.move`)

```move
public struct GasFutureToken has key, store {
    id: UID,
    expiry: u64,        // Unix timestamp
    gas_units: u64,     // Amount of gas
    strike_price: u64,  // Fixed price in SUI
}
```

**Functions:**

- `mint()`: Create new gas futures tokens
- `burn_expired()`: Clean up expired tokens
- `transfer()`: Standard token transfer functionality

#### 2. Risk Pool Management (`risk_pool.move`)

```move
public struct RiskPool has key {
    id: UID,
    collateral: Balance<SUI>,
    volatility_index: u64,
    total_deposits: u64,
}
```

**Functions:**

- `init_risk_pool()`: Initialize new risk pool
- `deposit()`: Add SUI collateral
- `calculate_premium()`: Dynamic premium calculation

#### 3. Sponsored Transactions (`redemption.move`)

```move
public entry fun redeem(
    token: GasFutureToken,
    pool: &mut RiskPool,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
)
```

**Features:**

- Zero-cost transaction execution
- Automatic token validation
- Gas deduction from futures balance

### Pricing Algorithm

Our Black-Scholes variant pricing model:

```move
// Premium calculation formula
let v_sqrt_t = (volatility * sqrt(time_to_expiry)) / 1000;
let premium = (current_gas_price * (10000 + v_sqrt_t)) / 10000;
```

**Components:**

- **Base Price**: Current SUI gas price
- **Volatility Factor**: Market volatility adjustment
- **Time Decay**: Time value of the option
- **Risk Premium**: Liquidity provider compensation
