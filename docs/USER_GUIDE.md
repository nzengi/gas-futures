# Gas Futures Protocol - User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Gas Futures Protocol! This guide will help you understand how to use our DeFi protocol to hedge gas price volatility on the SUI blockchain. Whether you're a developer, business, or individual user, this protocol allows you to secure predictable gas costs for future transactions.

## What is Gas Futures?

Gas futures are financial derivatives that allow you to lock in gas prices for future use. Similar to how oil futures work in traditional markets, gas futures help you:

- **Hedge against volatility**: Protect against sudden gas price spikes
- **Budget planning**: Predict and plan for future transaction costs
- **Cost efficiency**: Secure better rates during low volatility periods
- **Risk management**: Reduce exposure to gas price fluctuations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **SUI Wallet**: Install a SUI-compatible wallet (Sui Wallet, Suiet, etc.)
2. **SUI Tokens**: Have SUI tokens for purchasing gas futures
3. **Network Access**: Connect to SUI testnet or mainnet

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (for developers)
git clone https://github.com/nzengi/gas-futures.git
cd gas-futures

# Install dependencies
sui move build
```

## Core Features

### 1. Purchasing Gas Futures

#### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

- Open your SUI wallet
- Connect to the Gas Futures Protocol interface
- Ensure you have sufficient SUI balance

#### Step 2: Select Gas Futures

- Choose the amount of gas units you want to purchase
- Select the expiry date (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, etc.)
- Review the strike price and premium

#### Step 3: Complete Purchase

```bash
# Example: Purchase 1000 gas units for 1 month
sui client call \
    --package $PACKAGE_ID \
    --module futures_token \
    --function mint \
    --args $TREASURY_CAP $YOUR_ADDRESS 1000 100 1735689600 \
    --gas-budget 10000000
```

### 2. Managing Your Gas Futures

#### View Your Tokens

- Check your wallet for `GasFutureToken` objects
- Each token shows:
  - Gas units available
  - Strike price
  - Expiry date
  - Current market value

#### Token Details

```move
struct GasFutureToken {
    expiry: u64,        // Unix timestamp
    gas_units: u64,     // Amount of gas
    strike_price: u64,  // Fixed price in SUI
}
```

### 3. Redeeming Gas Futures

#### Step 1: Prepare Transaction

- Ensure your token hasn't expired
- Verify the transaction you want to execute
- Check current gas prices

#### Step 2: Execute Sponsored Transaction

```bash
# Redeem token for sponsored transaction
sui client call \
    --package $PACKAGE_ID \
    --module redemption \
    --function redeem \
    --args $TOKEN_ID $RISK_POOL_ID $CLOCK_ID \
    --gas-budget 10000000
```

#### Step 3: Transaction Execution

- Your transaction executes without gas cost
- Token is automatically burned
- Gas is deducted from your futures balance

## Advanced Features

### 1. Risk Pool Participation

#### Becoming a Liquidity Provider

- Deposit SUI into the risk pool
- Earn fees from gas futures trading
- Help provide liquidity to the protocol

```bash
# Deposit SUI into risk pool
sui client call \
    --package $PACKAGE_ID \
    --module risk_pool \
    --function deposit \
    --args $RISK_POOL_ID $SUI_COIN \
    --gas-budget 10000000
```

#### Risk Pool Benefits

- **Fee Sharing**: Earn a portion of trading fees
- **Volatility Premium**: Benefit from price volatility
- **Protocol Governance**: Participate in protocol decisions

### 2. Pricing Models

#### Understanding Premiums

The protocol uses a Black-Scholes variant for pricing:

```
Premium = Current Gas Price Ã— (1 + Volatility Factor)
Volatility Factor = (Volatility Ã— âˆšTime to Expiry) / 1000
```

#### Factors Affecting Price

- **Time to Expiry**: Longer periods = higher premiums
- **Market Volatility**: Higher volatility = higher premiums
- **Current Gas Price**: Base price for calculations
- **Risk Pool Capacity**: Available liquidity affects pricing

### 3. Oracle Integration

#### Real-Time Price Feeds

- Multiple oracle sources for price accuracy
- Automatic price updates
- Manipulation-resistant pricing

#### Price Sources

- SUI network gas price
- External oracle networks
- Community price feeds

## Use Cases

- Purchase new tokens for future use
- Monitor expiry dates proactively

#### 3. Insufficient Liquidity

**Problem**: Cannot purchase desired amount
**Solution**:

- Check risk pool capacity
- Try smaller amounts
- Wait for more liquidity

### Error Messages

| Error                   | Description           | Solution                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `ETOKEN_EXPIRED`        | Token has expired     | Purchase new token         |
| `EINSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Not enough gas units  | Check token balance        |

```javascript
// Example: Purchase gas futures via web3
const purchaseGasFutures = async (gasUnits, strikePrice, expiry) => {
  const txb = new TransactionBlock();

  txb.moveCall({
    target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::futures_token::mint`,
    arguments: [
      txb.object(TREASURY_CAP),
      txb.pure(buyerAddress),
      txb.pure(gasUnits),
      txb.pure(strikePrice),
      txb.pure(expiry),
    ],
